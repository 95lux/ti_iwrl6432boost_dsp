\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Factory Calibration Restoration and Configuration. 

This file implements the functionality to restore factory calibration data for the radar system. It reads calibration data from flash memory, validates its integrity using a magic number, and configures the radar front-\/end (FECSS) with the restored calibration parameters. The calibration process ensures optimal performance of the radar system by compensating for manufacturing variations and environmental factors.

Restores factory calibration data from flash. 

This function reads the calibration data stored in flash memory and restores it. It requires that the system has been previously calibrated.

Derived from {\ttfamily mmw\+Demo\+\_\+factory\+Cal} and {\ttfamily Mmw\+Demo\+\_\+calib\+Restore} in {\ttfamily \doxylink{factory__cal_8c}{factory\+\_\+cal.\+c}} from the demo project.
